{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"new-blog-2020","contentHtml":"<blockquote>\n<p>User Interfaces are like jokes; If you have to explain them, they're bad.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's exactly what my old website was: a bad joke. It was a quick something I threw together to\r\nbuild a decent looking blog. But this time, it's different. This iteration of my website was\r\nbuilt from the ground up (with the assistance of the <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app\">Next.js tutorial</a>)\r\nto be tailored to my needs. Using Next.js for the SSG, and <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">Tailwind</a> for the CSS, I think it turned out great!</p>\n<p>You can continue to expect this website to be unupdated as ever, and be a prime example\r\nof how lazy developers are at keeping blogs up to snuff. New projects are on the horizon,\r\nand I can't wait to show them off to you! Keep checking back for new updates on those,\r\nbut for now, deal with with this <em>slightly</em> better website.</p>\n","title":"The Dawn of a New Blog!","date":"2020-10-23"}},"__N_SSG":true}
