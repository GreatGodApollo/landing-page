That's exactly what my old website was: a bad joke. It was a quick something I threw together to
build a decent looking blog. But this time, it's different. This iteration of my website was
built from the ground up (with the assistance of the [Next.js tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app))
to be tailored to my needs. Using Next.js for the SSG, and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the CSS, I think it turned out great!

You can continue to expect this website to be unupdated as ever, and be a prime example
of how lazy developers are at keeping blogs up to snuff. New projects are on the horizon,
and I can't wait to show them off to you! Keep checking back for new updates on those,
but for now, deal with with this *slightly* better website.
